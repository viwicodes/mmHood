## Infant milestones and more

Babies at this age are social and love to interact. Here are the ways in which you can identify
whether their milestones are achieved.

### MOTORSKILLS:

At two months , babies have sucking reflex , you may notice your baby likes to lick on fist or few
fingers as well. This way they try to soothe themselves.
Though they cant hold toys at this stage, they have a wide look at the colorful object or toy
hanging infront of them.

### SLEEP:

day , you cannot imagine to have a full night’s sleep .

At two months , babies should be breastfed every 3 to 4 hours during the day with longer
stretches at night. You can expect 4 to 6 wet diapers a day.

### SENSES:

Baby will be able to see your face well while breastfeeding , they enjoy listening to the sound of your voice.

### COMMUNICATION:

At 2 months , most communication is of crying but you can hear from sweet coos and gurgles ,
grunts also.

### TIPS TO ACHIEVE MILESTONES:

* Touch is very important in the initial months , try to maintain skin contact by massaging ,
holding or rocking the baby.
