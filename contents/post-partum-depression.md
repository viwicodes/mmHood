A life in which you listen to your body and your mind every day.
A life in which you feel in control of yourself.
A life in which you don’t need a big packet of biscuits in front of the tv because you
don’t know how to deal with difficult emotions or because you are so stressed that
you only want to forget everything and watch Netflix, wishing that your life was like
the grand finale episode of the series!
Be realistic with yourself by remembering that it takes time to understand something new
about yourself.
